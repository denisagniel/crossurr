Description: Doubly robust methods for evaluating surrogate markers as outlined in: Agniel D, Hejblum BP, Thiebaut R & Parast L (2022). 
             "Doubly robust evaluation of high-dimensional surrogate markers", Biostatistics <doi:10.1093/biostatistics/kxac020>. You can use these methods to determine how much of the overall treatment effect is explained by a (possibly high-dimensinoal) set of surrogate markers.

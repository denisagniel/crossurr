`crossurr` is an `R` package that implements cross-fitting for 
doubly robust evaluation of high-dimensional surrogate markers.

You can use these methods to determine how much of the overall treatment effect 
is explained by a (possibly high-dimensional) set of surrogate markers.

More details on the method is available in Agniel D, Hejblum BP, Thi√©baut R & 
Parast L (2022), "Doubly robust evaluation of high-dimensional surrogate 
markers", *Biostatistics* <doi:10.1093/biostatistics/kxac020>. 

The main functions of this package are `xf_surrogate` and `xfr_surrogate`
